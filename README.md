# About the project

> "Happy Dish" was a side project to get me up to speed with mobile development using Flutter and Dart.

For all those who ask or get asked the same question over and over again: *"What should we eat today?"*. Let fate decide and don't waste any more time on this tedious question.

# Features

The app allows you to enter dishes that would come into question. You can view and delete them on a separate page. After filling the list with eligible dishes, you can press a button to let the sophisticated algorithm do its work. Within a very short time, you will get an answer presented in an appealing way.

- Clean and minimalistic design (Material3)
- Storage of the entries for reuse (shared_preferences)
- Eye friendly dark color theme
- Neither tracking nor advertising
